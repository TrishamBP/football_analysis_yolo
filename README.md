# Football Analysis

This repository contains an advanced football match analysis project that leverages state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and machine learning models to extract and analyze key insights from football match videos.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a sophisticated system that automates the analysis of football (soccer) games using deep learning and computer vision. It tracks player movements, detects key events, and provides data-driven insights from the match, enabling teams, coaches, and analysts to make informed decisions based on objective data.

### Features

- **Player Detection and Tracking**: Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection to identify players on the field. OpenCV is then employed to track their movements throughout the game, providing a comprehensive view of player positioning and movement patterns.

- **Event Detection**: Identifies and timestamps key events such as goals, shots on target, fouls, and tackles using advanced computer vision techniques. This feature allows for quick compilation of match highlights and detailed event analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: Generates heatmaps of player movement, offering insights into team formations, player roles, and strategic positioning. Additionally, it provides visual representations of possession statistics, pass networks, and other crucial match data.

- **Team and Player Performance Analysis**: Calculates and presents a wide array of statistics including distance covered by players, number of passes completed, pass accuracy, shots taken, and other metrics to evaluate individual and team performance objectively.

## Tools & Technologies

This project leverages cutting-edge technologies in computer vision and machine learning:

- **YOLOv5**: State-of-the-art, real-time object detection framework, fine-tuned for detecting players, referees, and the ball with high accuracy.

- **OpenCV**: Powerful computer vision library used for video processing, object tracking, and image manipulation tasks.

- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used to implement and train the YOLO model, allowing for efficient GPU acceleration and custom model architectures.

- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries used for creating high-quality, informative visualizations of match data, including heatmaps, event timelines, and statistical charts.

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library used for efficient handling and analysis of large datasets generated from match analysis.
